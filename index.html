            <li>Prioritizing those needs.</li>
            <li>Working and managing a team of industry experts who collaborate to work on complex projects.</li>

          <h2>About Jessa</h2>
          <p>After graduating college as a healthcare professional and working in the field for 4 years, I realized that I never truly enjoyed working in the industry as much as I loved to create websites as a freelancer.</p>
          <p>As a student at <strong>Thinkful</strong>, I have begun my journey as a software developer and couldn't be happier!</p>
          <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer (or are looking for a partner for a collaborative project), please reach out to me! I am so excited to work with other developers to build great software.</p>
